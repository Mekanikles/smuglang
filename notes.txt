Notes

strings hurt in C++
	way too easy to be super inefficient with strings
		Copies everywhere, concatenation inefficient, how did D to it?
	built-in string type?

grammar should have unambiguous uniform function delcaration
	func(int, int, ... -> bool, float)

	func is implicit pointer type? May do not mix data and function types in terms of pointers, when ever to use non-pointer functions?


support raw strings
	syntax? #raw_string(hej det här är en \\\\\\ konstig string)

= should not be an expression?
	Removes if (a = 5) mistake and other ambiguities

	solve local assignment bodies:
		if (Val* x = getValPtr())
		{
			x->doStuff();
		}


should support macros?
	Good usage of macros:
		LINE, PLATFORM
		LOG(tex)
			used because you want callsite info in logging
		PROFILE_SCOPE
			used because you want to inject scope objects in outer scope
